This is a simple app built with react,redux,firebase and materialize.

I used firebase'a auth service(signInWithEmailAndPassword) for this app's authentication function. Additionally I used firestore for data management. For the notifcation components I used Firebase's cloud function.

Finally I ran 'npm run build' and built a react build folder and used it for the hosting.

I used the firebase hosting for the app deployment. You can see it live on https://redux-react-project-management.firebaseapp.com/signin
